# SkyPort Online Stargazing Forum
## Deployed: skyport.herokuapp.com

SkyPort is an online forum where users can share and discuss their stargazing experiences.

I designed and wrote this project using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB.

### Note: 
This project is intended to only work as currently deployed on Heroku. 

As such, the code will not work locally without changing some of its structure and setting some environment variables.
